<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is my first project ever which was done barely a month into learning how to program. It's a simple blog to rank my favorite TV Shows, Animes and Mangas. The ranking in and of itself is hard coded, as the focus was on an infinite Reddit like comment-reply functionality ( which require recursive functions ), as well as a notification and comment-report functionality.

### Built With

* [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
* [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
